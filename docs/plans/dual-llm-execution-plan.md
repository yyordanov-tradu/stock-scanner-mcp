## Phases

### Phase 1 — Foundation (sequential, alternating)
Tasks 01–07. Must be done in order because later tasks depend on earlier ones.

- Gemini: 01, 02, 06
- Claude: 03, 04, 05, 07

### Phase 2 — Modules (parallel, no file conflicts)
Tasks 08–13. Each module is self-contained in its own directory. Can be done in parallel.

- Claude: 08 (TradingView), 10 (SEC EDGAR), 12 (Finnhub) → 9 tools
- Gemini: 09 (TradingView Crypto), 11 (CoinGecko), 13 (Alpha Vantage) → 10 tools

### Phase 3 — Integration (sequential)
Tasks 14–15. Must happen after all modules are complete.

- Claude: 14 (Integration Test)
- Gemini: 15 (README)

## Cross-LLM Review Protocol

```
Author LLM completes task
    → TDD: write test → fail → implement → pass
    → Triple review (Senior Engineer + Architect + QA) — all must APPROVE
    → Open PR with review notes in body
    → Log: PR_OPENED in activity log, push to main
    → Other LLM reviews the PR
        → If APPROVED: comment with approval
        → If CHANGES REQUESTED: author fixes, re-reviews
    → Author merges own PR after receiving APPROVED (no user approval needed)
    → Author updates status table + logs MERGED in activity log, pushes to main
    → Before starting next task: check for open PRs from other LLM to review
```

### Rules
1. **Always check before starting:** Before picking up a new task, check for open PRs from the other LLM and review them first.
2. **One task at a time:** Don't start a new task until the current one is merged.
3. **Update this file:** After each task is merged, update the status table above and push to main.
4. **Branch naming:** `task/XX-description` (e.g., `task/07-mcp-server`).
5. **PR approval for same-account repos:** Since both LLMs use the same GitHub account, approval is done via a comment (not the GitHub review API). Comment must include the triple review verdict.
6. **Dependencies:** Phase 2 tasks depend on Phase 1 being complete. Phase 3 depends on Phase 2.
7. **Self-merge after approval:** Once the other LLM posts an APPROVED comment on your PR, you are authorized to merge it to main yourself. No user approval needed. After merging: update this file's status table + activity log, then pick up your next task.
8. **Workflow per task:** START → implement (TDD) → triple review → PR_OPENED → wait for other LLM's review → if APPROVED: merge → MERGED → update this file → check for other LLM's PRs → next task.

## Activity Log

> **MANDATORY:** Both LLMs MUST log every action here with a clear timestamp, task number, and action type. This is how the other LLM knows what happened and what to do next. Push to main after every log entry.

### Action Types
- `START` — Beginning work on a task
- `PR_OPENED` — PR created, awaiting cross-LLM review (include PR number)
- `PR_REVIEWED` — Reviewed the other LLM's PR (include PR number + verdict: APPROVED / CHANGES_REQUESTED)
- `PR_FIXED` — Addressed review feedback, PR updated
- `MERGED` — PR merged to main (include PR number)
- `BLOCKED` — Waiting on dependency or other LLM's action
- `NOTE` — General coordination message

### Format
```
| Timestamp | LLM | Task | Action | Details |
```
