A modular MCP server for Claude Code and Claude Desktop that provides real-time access to stock and crypto market data. Scan markets, check technicals, monitor insider trades, track earnings, analyze options flow, and optionally save your own watchlists and thesis notes from one server.

**64 tools** across **13 modules** — 9 modules work with zero API keys, including an optional stateful Market Workspace.

## Quick Start

Three steps to get the full experience: server config, trading skills, and workspace setup.

### Step 1 — Add the server to your MCP config

Copy this complete config block into your config file:

- **Claude Code:** `~/.claude.json` (global) or `.mcp.json` (project-local)
- **Claude Desktop:** `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` (macOS) or `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json` (Windows)

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "stock-scanner": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "stock-scanner-mcp", "--enable-workspace"],
      "env": {
        "FINNHUB_API_KEY": "your-key-here",
        "ALPHA_VANTAGE_API_KEY": "your-key-here",
        "FRED_API_KEY": "your-key-here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

This gives you **43 tools** immediately with no API keys. API keys are optional and free — they unlock 18 additional tools for real-time quotes, news, earnings, and economic data. See [API Keys](#api-keys-optional) below for where to get them.

> **Minimal config** — if you don't want workspace or API keys, use this instead:
> ```json
> {
>   "mcpServers": {
>     "stock-scanner": {
>       "command": "npx",
>       "args": ["-y", "stock-scanner-mcp"]
>     }
>   }
> }
> ```
> This gives you **36 stateless tools** with no local data storage.

Restart Claude Desktop after saving. Claude Code picks up the config automatically.

### Step 2 — Install the trading skills

Run this command in your terminal:

```bash
npx -p stock-scanner-mcp stock-scanner-install-skills
```

This installs 19 slash commands (like `/morning-briefing`, `/analyze-stock AAPL`, `/setup-market-workspace`) into `~/.claude/skills/` so they're available in every Claude Code session. See [Trading Skills](#trading-skills) for the full list.

### Step 3 — Set up your workspace

Run `/setup-market-workspace` in Claude Code. It asks three quick questions:

```
> /setup-market-workspace

Setting up your market workspace — I'll ask a few quick questions to get started...

1. What kind of trader or investor are you?
   (e.g., options trader, swing trader, long-term investor, crypto-focused)

   → "I'm mostly a swing trader, also watch crypto"

2. Which names or assets should I save to your core watchlist?
   (e.g., AAPL, MARA, BTC, Gold)

   → "MARA, HOOD, SOFI, BTC, ETH"

3. Do you want a daily or weekly market review?

   → "Daily"
```

Once answered, it saves your profile and creates a `core` watchlist:

```
✓ Workspace saved

  Profile     swing trader | daily review
  Watchlist   core — MARA, HOOD, SOFI, BTC, ETH
```

You can also skip the skill and ask Claude directly: *"Set up my workspace — I'm a swing trader, create a core watchlist with MARA, HOOD, BTC, daily reviews."*

**That's it.** You now have 64 tools, 19 skills, and a personalized workspace. Try `/workspace-morning-brief` for your first tailored market scan.

## What You Can Do

```
"What are the top gaining stocks today?"
"Show me technicals for AAPL on the hourly timeframe"
"Any insider trades for TSLA in the last 30 days?"
"What's the options chain for AAPL expiring next Friday?"
"What's the current fed funds rate and CPI trend?"
"Convert $10,000 USD to EUR"
"Set up a core watchlist with MARA, HOOD, and BTC"
"Give me a personalized morning brief for my saved watchlist"
```

### Highlights

- **Stock scanning** — screen by price, RSI, volume, market cap with custom filters
- **Technical analysis** — RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, moving averages, pivots across multiple timeframes
- **Options flow** — chains with Greeks, unusual activity detection, max pain, implied move
- **Insider trades** — parsed Form 4 transactions with buy/sell/grant details
- **Earnings & news** — calendar, analyst ratings, company news, short interest
- **Crypto** — real-time quotes, technicals, trending coins, market stats
- **Macro** — CPI, GDP, fed funds rate, economic calendar, yield curve data
- **Forex** — 31 currency pairs from ECB, conversion, historical rates
- **Sentiment** — CNN Fear & Greed Index, Crypto Fear & Greed
- **Market Workspace** — save a trading profile, named watchlists, and thesis notes for personalized workflows across sessions

## Trading Skills

19 ready-made workflows that chain multiple tools into structured analysis. Each skill orchestrates 5-14 tools in parallel and outputs a verdict with direction, confidence, and key levels.

| Category | Skills | What They Do |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| **Daily Routines** | `/morning-briefing`, `/market-close-recap`, `/crypto-briefing` | Pre-market scan, EOD recap, crypto overview |
| **Analysis** | `/analyze-stock TICKER`, `/compare TICKER1 TICKER2`, `/analyze-crypto COIN` | Deep dives and side-by-side comparisons |
| **Strategies** | `/swing-setup`, `/earnings-play TICKER`, `/options-flow TICKER`, `/dividend-screen` | Swing trades, earnings options, smart money, income screen |
| **Macro** | `/macro-dashboard`, `/fed-watch`, `/sector-rotation` | Economic indicators, Fed outlook, sector rotation |
| **Risk** | `/insider-tracker TICKER`, `/smart-money TICKER`, `/risk-check TICKER` | Insider trades, institutional flow, pre-trade risk scorecard |
| **Workspace** | `/setup-market-workspace`, `/workspace-morning-brief` | Guided setup for saved profile/watchlist context and a personalized brief driven by your stored names |

Skills degrade gracefully when optional API keys are missing. Workspace skills require `--enable-workspace` in the server config.

## Market Workspace

The Market Workspace is an optional stateful layer that remembers your trading context across sessions — your trading style, named watchlists, and investment thesis notes per symbol. Skills like `/workspace-morning-brief` use this context to deliver personalized market scans instead of generic ones.

### What you can do with it

- **`/workspace-morning-brief`** — personalized pre-market scan that reads your profile and watchlist, checks earnings, news, and price action for your names, and highlights what matters today
- **Add more watchlists** — ask Claude: *"Create a watchlist called 'earnings' with AAPL, MSFT, GOOG"*
- **Track investment theses** — save your reasoning per ticker so the system monitors it for you (see below)
- **Update anytime** — *"Add NVDA to my core watchlist"* or *"Change my review cadence to weekly"*

### Thesis Tracking

Save your investment reasoning per ticker — direction, key levels, catalysts, and timeframe — so the system can monitor it across sessions.

**Save a thesis:**

```
"My thesis on NIO: bullish above $6.35, that confirms the uptrend. Below it the setup is invalid."
```

Claude saves the structured thesis:

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Direction | Bullish above $6.35 |
| Bear case | Below $6.35 uptrend is invalidated |
| Catalyst | Technical breakout at $6.35 |
| Timeframe | Swing |

**How it works in practice:** When you run `/workspace-morning-brief`, the brief cross-references your saved theses against live price action:

- NIO drops to $6.10 → *"NIO broke below your $6.35 thesis floor — re-evaluate."*
- NIO rallies to $7.20 → *"NIO holding above your $6.35 level — uptrend thesis intact."*

Without a thesis, the brief just reports a price change. With a thesis, it tells you **whether the move matters to your plan.**

Each thesis supports five fields: `summary`, `bullCase`, `bearCase`, `catalyst`, and `timeframe`. You can save up to 200 theses per workspace.

### Configuration reference

| Option | Default | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `--enable-workspace` | off | Activate the 7 workspace tools |
| `--data-dir <path>` | `~/.stock-scanner-mcp` | Directory for `workspace.json` storage |
| `--default-exchange` | `NASDAQ` | Default exchange for ticker resolution |

Data is stored locally in `workspace.json` — no cloud sync, no external calls. If you omit `--enable-workspace`, the server stays fully stateless and writes no local data.

Add them to the `env` block in your MCP config (see [Quick Start](#step-1--add-the-server-to-your-mcp-config)).

### Use with other MCP clients

Any MCP client that supports stdio servers can run this package. Use the same JSON config from [Quick Start](#step-1--add-the-server-to-your-mcp-config). If your client does not expose `npx`, install the package first and point the client at the installed binary instead.

## HTTP Sidecar

An optional HTTP server exposing all tools as REST endpoints for non-MCP integrations (trading bots, chat UIs, LLM pipelines).

```bash
npx stock-scanner-sidecar              # Start on port 3200
npx stock-scanner-sidecar --port 8080  # Custom port
```

55 endpoints including `/tradingview/quote`, `/options/chain`, `/frankfurter/convert`, and more. See [wiki](https://github.com/yyordanov-tradu/stock-scanner-mcp/wiki/Sidecar-HTTP-API) for the full route table.

## Rate Limits

| API | Free Tier Limit | Cache TTL |
|-----|-----------------|-----------|
| TradingView | No documented limit | — |
| SEC EDGAR | 10 req/sec | 5 min |
| CoinGecko | ~30 calls/min | 1 min |
| Yahoo Finance (Options) | No documented limit | 5 min |
| CBOE | No documented limit | 30 min |
